Under the Trajectory selection, nothing was selected. The Atom Selection was set to protein. Under the Reference selection, the Molecule ID was select as 'self' and the Window was selected as reference, and the Window was set to one to align using RMSF. After these selections were made, the molecule was aligned by pressing the 'Align' button. A warning is received that you are using RMSF for alignment. Press 'Ok' to proceed with alignment. The result will put all of your frames to the same relative space. However, if the homodimer crossed the the periodic boundary of the box, these will not be aligned. Only frames that did not have the homodimer separated will be completely aligned.\n",

      "The above selection and script was created to avoid atoms clashing into one another based on the beta-factors from the crystallographic information provided from the PDB file from RCSB.org. The selections were made so that the alignment was only carried out on the residues with the least amount of movement. This was necessary for this trajectory, as it was observed that the beta-hairpin flaps of HIV-1 Protease open during this simulation and the flaps switch sides. Therefore, alignment to a single reference structure produced many atomic clashes that would not be occurring. In the above code, we have implemented alignment such that it aligns to the previous frame, which was just aligned. However, we still start at frame 0, such that the alignment is in the same frame of reference."

      "This last script was implemented for 1dif since all previously created scripts failed to align the protein without atomic clashes. In this instance, we have two different alignments happening. The first is very similar to the 1hsg script, with the exception that it is only applied to the alpha carbons this time, and it is only applied to the first 8000 frames. This was because the next part of the script which selects all of the alpha carbons of both chaines would produce atomic clashes in the first 8000 frames, but the first part of the script would produce clashes in the latter part of the trajectory. So the second part of the script selects all the alpha carbons of the of both chains, and proceeds to align the remainder of the trajectory. Also, 1dif, like 1hsg, was observed to have its beta-hairpin flaps open and then switch sides of the protein as well. This may be the source of difficulty when aligning this particular protein."
